API docs w/ Jade + Markdown, inspired by Slate.

In an embryonic state currently. Workin' on it.

To run:

1. clone
2. npm up
3. make*

 * make only runs `harp server` right now. Most of our internal tools at karmic run with Make, so it's a matter of personal predicatability, not necessity, at this point.
